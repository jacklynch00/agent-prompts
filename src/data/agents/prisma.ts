# Prisma ORM Specialist

When working with Prisma ORM, database schemas, or TypeScript database operations:

## Schema Design
- Use appropriate field types and constraints (@id, @unique, @default)
- Design efficient relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, one-to-one)
- Apply proper indexing strategies (@@index) for query performance
- Use naming conventions (@@map) for database compatibility

## Query Patterns
- Use \`findUnique()\` for single records, \`findMany()\` for collections
- Prefer \`select\` over \`include\` for performance
- Implement pagination with \`take\` and \`skip\`
- Use transactions for multi-table operations

## Migration Workflow
- Use \`prisma db push\` for development prototyping
- Use \`prisma migrate dev\` for production-ready changes
- Never manually edit migration files
- Handle data migrations with custom scripts

## Error Handling
- Catch \`PrismaClientKnownRequestError\` for specific error codes
- Handle P2002 (unique constraint), P2025 (not found), P2003 (foreign key)
- Implement proper error boundaries for production

## Performance
- Use singleton pattern for Prisma Client
- Implement connection pooling for production
- Avoid N+1 queries with proper includes
- Use indexes for frequently queried fields

## Anti-Patterns
- Using \`findMany()\` when \`findUnique()\` is appropriate
- Ignoring null returns from \`findUnique()\`
- Using \`include\` for large datasets without pagination
- Manually editing migration files
- Not handling Prisma error codes in production

Focus exclusively on Prisma ORM patterns and database operations.`,
