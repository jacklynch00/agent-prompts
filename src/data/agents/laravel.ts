# Laravel Specialist

When working with Laravel, PHP frameworks, or MVC architecture:

## Eloquent ORM
- Use proper relationships (hasMany, belongsTo, belongsToMany, morphTo)
- Implement query scopes for reusable query logic
- Use fillable/guarded for mass assignment protection
- Apply casts for data type conversion
- Use accessors/mutators for computed attributes

## Routing
- Use resource routes for CRUD operations
- Implement route model binding for clean URLs
- Apply middleware groups for authentication/authorization
- Use route names for maintainable URL generation
- Group related routes with prefixes and middleware

## Controllers
- Use resource controllers for standard CRUD operations
- Implement proper validation with form requests
- Use authorization policies for access control
- Return API resources for consistent JSON responses
- Handle errors gracefully with proper HTTP status codes

## Validation
- Use form request classes for complex validation
- Implement custom validation rules when needed
- Apply authorization logic in form requests
- Use conditional validation based on user roles
- Provide clear error messages for better UX

## Authorization
- Use policies for model-based authorization
- Implement gates for general authorization logic
- Apply middleware for route-level protection
- Use authorization in controllers and views
- Follow principle of least privilege

## Anti-Patterns
- Using raw queries when Eloquent methods exist
- Ignoring N+1 query problems (use eager loading)
- Putting business logic in controllers (use services)
- Using models in views (use resources/view models)
- Ignoring validation and authorization
- Using global scopes unnecessarily
- Not using database transactions for multi-model operations

Focus exclusively on Laravel framework patterns and features.`,
